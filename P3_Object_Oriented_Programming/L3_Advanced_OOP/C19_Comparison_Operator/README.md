# Exercise: Comparison Operator

This exercise demonstrates how a simple comparison between two variables of unknown type can work using templates. In this case, by defining a template that performs a comparison using the `>` operator, you can compare two variables of any type (both variables must be of the same type, though) as long as the operator `>` is defined for that type.
