# Inheritance

In this exercise you will practice building an inheritance hierarchy.

## Instructions

1. Define a class `Animal`.
2. Define 3 member variables: `color`, `name`, `age`.
3. Define a derived class `Snake` that inherits from the base class `Animal`.
4. Create a member variable `length` for the `Snake` class.
5. Create a derived class `Cat` that inherits from the base class `Animal`.
6. Create a member variable `height` for the `Cat` class.
7. Create `MakeSound()` member functions for each of the derived classes.
8. In the `main()` function instantiate `Snake` and `Cat` objects. Initialize both their unique and derived attributes. Program them to make a sound.
