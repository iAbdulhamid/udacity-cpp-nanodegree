# Polymorphism: Overriding

["Overriding"](http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#glossary) a function occurs when:

1. A base class declares a `virtual` function.
2. A derived class `override`s that virtual function by defining its own implementation with an identical function signature _(i.e. the same function name and argument types)_.

```C++
class Animal {
public:
  virtual std::string Talk() const = 0;
};

class Cat {
public:
  std::string Talk() const { return std::string("Meow"); }
};
```

In this example, `Animal` exposes a `virtual` function: `Talk()`, but does not define it. Because `Animal::Talk()` is undefined, it is called a [pure virtual function](http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#glossary), as opposed to an ordinary (impure? ðŸ˜‰) virtual function.

Furthermore, because `Animal` contains a pure virtual function, the user cannot instantiate an object of type `Animal`. This makes `Animal` an [abstract class](http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#glossary).

`Cat`, however, inherits from `Animal` and overrides `Animal::Talk()` with `Cat::Talk()`, which is defined. Therefore, it is possible to instantiate an object of type `Cat`.

## Instructions

1. Create a class `Dog` to inherit from `Animal`.
2. Define `Dog::Talk()` to override the virtual function `Animal::Talk()`.
3. Confirm that the tests pass.

# Function Hiding

Function hiding is [closely related, but distinct from](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19736281/what-are-the-differences-between-overriding-virtual-functions-and-hiding-non-vir), overriding.

A derived class hides a base class function, as opposed to overriding it, if the base class function is not specified to be `virtual`.

```C++
class Cat { // Here, Cat does not derive from a base class
public:
  std::string Talk() const { return std::string("Meow"); }
};

class Lion : public Cat {
public:
  std::string Talk() const { return std::string("Roar"); }
};
```

In this example, `Cat` is the base class and `Lion` is the derived class. Both `Cat` and `Lion` have `Talk()` member functions.

When an object of type `Lion` calls `Talk()`, the object will run `Lion::Talk()`, not `Cat::Talk()`.

In this situation, `Lion::Talk()` is hiding `Cat::Talk()`. If `Cat::Talk()` were `virtual`, then `Lion::Talk()` would **override** `Cat::Talk()`, instead of **hiding** it. _Overriding requires a `virtual` function in the base class_.

The distinction between **overriding** and **hiding** is subtle and not terribly significant, but in certain situations hiding **[can lead to bizarre errors]**(https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/strange-inheritance), particularly when the two functions have slightly different function signatures.
