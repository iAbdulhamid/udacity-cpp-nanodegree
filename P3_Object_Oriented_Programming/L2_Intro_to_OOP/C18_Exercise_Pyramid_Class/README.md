# Exercise: Pyramid Class

1. Create a class: `Pyramid`.
2. Create 3 attributes: `length`, `width`, and `height`.
3. Create a constructor to initialize all the attributes.
4. Create accessor and mutator functions for all attributes.
5. Think about the appropriate invariants and enforce them by throwing exceptions.
6. Create a member function to calculate the volume of the pyramid.
7. Optional: create a member function to calculate the surface area of the pyramid.

## Volume

The volume of a pyramid is [length x width x height / 3](https://www.wikihow.com/Calculate-the-Volume-of-a-Pyramid).
