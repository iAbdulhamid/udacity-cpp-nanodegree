# Exercise: Sphere Class

In this exercise you will practice abstraction by creating a class which represents a sphere.

Declare:

1. A constructor function that takes the radius as an argument
2. A member function that returns the [volume](https://www.google.com/search?q=sphere+volume)

## Directions

1. Define a class called `Sphere`.
2. Add one private member variable: `radius`.
3. Define a constructor to initialize the radius.
4. Define an accessor method that returns the radius.
5. Define a member function to return the volume of the sphere.
6. Write a `main()` function to initialize an object of type Sphere.
