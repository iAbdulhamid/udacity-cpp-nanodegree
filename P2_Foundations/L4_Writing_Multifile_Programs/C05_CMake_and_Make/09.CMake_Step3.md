# CMake Step 3

Next, we want to add an executable to this project. You can do that with the `add_executable` command by specifying the executable name, along with the locations of all the source files that you will need. `CMake` has the ability to automatically find source files in a directory, but for now, you can just specify each file needed:

```
add_executable(your_executable_name  path_to_file_1  path_to_file_2 ...)
```
