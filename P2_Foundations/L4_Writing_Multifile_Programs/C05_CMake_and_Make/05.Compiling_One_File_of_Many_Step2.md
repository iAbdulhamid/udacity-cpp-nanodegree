# Compiling One File of Many, Step 2

- But what if you make changes to your code and you need to re-compile? In that case, you can compile only the file that you changed, and you can use the existing object files from the unchanged source files for linking.

- Try changing the code in `/multiple_files_example/main.cpp` to have different numbers in the vector and save the file with `CTRL-s`.

```
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include "increment_and_sum.h"
using std::vector;
using std::cout;

int main()
{
    vector<int> v{1, 2, 3, 4, 6};
    int total = IncrementAndComputeVectorSum(v);
    cout << "The total is: " << total << "\n";
}
```

- When you have done that, re-compile just `main.cpp` by running:

```
/multiple_files_example# g++ -c main.cpp
/multiple_files_example# g++ *.o
/multiple_files_example# ./a.out
```

- Compiling just the file you have changed saves time if there are many files and compilation takes a long time. However, the process above is tedious when using many files, especially if you don't remember which ones you have modified.
