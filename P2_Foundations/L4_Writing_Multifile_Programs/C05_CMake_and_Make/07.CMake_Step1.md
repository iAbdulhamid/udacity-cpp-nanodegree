# CMake Step 1

In the terminal, navigate to the cmake_example folder. This folder should contain a simple CMake project, including:

- An empty `CMakeLists.txt` file
- A `src` directory with the `increment_and_sum` and `vect_add_one` files from previous concepts.

You will write a basic `CMakeLists.txt` file to build all of these project files into an executable.

The first lines that you'll want in your `CMakeLists.txt` are lines that specifies the minimum versions of `cmake` and `C++` required to build the project. Add the following lines to your `CMakeLists.txt` and save the file:

```
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.5.1)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 14)
```

These lines set the minimum `cmake` version required to 3.5.1 and set the environment variable `CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD` so `CMake` uses `C++ 14`. On your own computer, if you have a recent g++ compiler, you could use `C++ 17` instead.
