# CMake Step 4

A typical `CMake` project will have a build directory in the same place as the top-level `CMakeLists.txt`. Make a build directory in the /cmake_example folder:

```
/cmake_example# mkdir build
/cmake_example# cd build
```

From within the `build` directory, you can now run `CMake` as follows:

```
/cmake_example/build# cmake ..
/cmake_example/build# make
```

The first line directs the `cmake` command at the top-level `CMakeLists.txt` file with `..`. This command uses the `CMakeLists.txt` to configure the project and create a `Makefile` in the `build` directory.
In the second line, `make` finds the `Makefile` and uses the instructions in the `Makefile` to build the project.
