# CMake Review

Excellent work! You've now written a basic `CMakeLists.txt` file that builds a small project for you.

CMake is a build system that uses text files named `CMakeLists.txt` to configure and build your project. Once the `CMakeLists.txt` is written, you only need the `cmake` and `make` commands to build your project again and again, so it is very convenient to use!

You should now have a better understanding of the mechanics of CMake, and you are ready to start experimenting with CMake on your own projects.
