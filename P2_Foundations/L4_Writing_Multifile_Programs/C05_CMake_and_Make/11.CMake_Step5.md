If everything has worked correctly, you should now be able to run your executable from the `build` folder:

```
/cmake_example/build# ./<your_executable_name>
```

If you don't remember the name of your executable, the last line of the `make` output should tell you:

```
[100%] Built target <your_executable_name>
```
