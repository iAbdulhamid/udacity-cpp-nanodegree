# CMake Step 2

`CMake` requires that we name the project, so you should choose a name for the project and then add the following line to `CMakeLists.txt`:

```
project(<your_project_name>)
```

_You can choose any name you want, but be sure to change `<your_project_name>` to the actual name of the project!_
