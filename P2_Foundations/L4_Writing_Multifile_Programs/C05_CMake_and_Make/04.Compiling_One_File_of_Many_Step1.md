# Compiling One File of Many, Step 1

- In the previous example, you compiled a single source code file to an object file, and that object file was then converted into an executable.

- Now you are going to try the same process with multiple files. Navigate to the `multiple_files_example` directory in the terminal. This directory should have the `increment_and_sum` and `vect_add_one` files from a previous concept. Try compiling with the commands below:

```
/multiple_files_example# g++ -c *.cpp
/multiple_files_example# g++ *.o
/multiple_files_example# ./a.out
```

Here, the `*` operator is a wildcard, so any matching file is selected.
If you compile and run these files together, the executable should print:

> The total is: 14
