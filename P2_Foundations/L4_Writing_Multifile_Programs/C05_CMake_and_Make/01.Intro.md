# CMake and Make

- In the previous concepts, you saw how example code could be split into multiple `.h` and `.cpp` files,
  and you used `g++` to build all of the files together.
  For small projects with a handful of files, this works well.
  But what would happen if there were hundreds, or even thousands, of files in the project?
  You could type the names of the files at the command line each time, but there tools to make this easier.

- Many larger C++ projects use a `build system` to manage all the files during the build process.
  The build system allows for large projects:

  1. to be compiled with a few commands,
  2. and build systems are able to do this in an efficient way by only recompiling files that have been changed.

- In this concept you will learn about:
  1. **Object files**: what actually happens when you run `g++`.
  2. How to use object files to compile only a single file at a time.
     If you have many files in a project, this will allow you can compile only files that have changed and need to be re-compiled.
  3. How to use `cmake (and make)`, a build system which is popular in large C++ projects.
     CMake will simplify the process of building project and re-compiling only the changed files.
