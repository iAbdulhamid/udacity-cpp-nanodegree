# CMake Step 6

Now that your project builds correctly, try modifying one of the files. When you are ready to run the project again, you'll only need to run the make command from the build folder, and only that file will be compiled again. Try it now!

In general, `CMake` only needs to be run once for a project, unless you are changing build options (e.g. using different build flags or changing where you store your files).

Make will be able to keep track of which files have changed and compile only those that need to be compiled before building.

**Note:** If you do re-run `CMake`, or if you are having problems with your build, it can be helpful to delete your build directory and start from scratch. Otherwise, some environment variables may not be reset correctly.
